1.  Putting two images in the background with css:
    Use background-image property and two "url()" seperated by a comma, with background-position position the images following the same order you set the image-files

2. you can :root the fontsize as well (But I won't use it here since I don't know the exact font-sizes)

3. Media queries:
a) If I set a max-width property all the values inside that media query will apply when the device's theoretically from size zero to the max-width value.
b) If I set a min-width property all the values inside that media query will apply when the device's size is from min-width to the maxium size of your device's screen

4. If there's margin or padding in the basic css style and I want to omit the margins and paddings in the media query I have to strictly set those values for the specific selectors to zero
