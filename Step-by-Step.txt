1. Put all the missing elements in the head element of the html file like links, meta etc.

2. Create a style.css file and link it to the html page

3. create a general html style:
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: ???;
}

4. create a body style:
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: ???;
}

5. setting the width and height of the body element. I start with the mobile first rule, so I set the max-width to 375px and min-height to 100vh

6. set the margin to 0 auto in the body element and also padding to 20px. margin centers the body elements and padding give the body a left and right space

7. give the body element's top and bottom padding 90px to add space on the top and bottom of the page

8. Since most of the texts are centred I use the text-align property in the body element as well

9. I try to figure out the different sections and plan out how many divs I need and how to structure it the best using pen and paper

10. Write down all the texts and put them in the appropriate tag-elements 

11. Adding all the image files needed

12. I put the images for the background as a css background styling

13. It's time to insert the divs and section elements

14. setting classes to the elements for styling purposes beginning from top to bottom

15. I set and margin and padding to zero in a universal selector (*) to apply it to all elements so I have more control over the element's margin and padding
